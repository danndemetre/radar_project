	<h2>About</h2>				
<p>This is a project to develop a web application for a range finding radar system. The purpose of this website will be to combine use an FPGA to interface with hardware to excite a monopole transducer. The FPGA will generate a ping at a regular interval and use it's onboard ADC for singal processing. A Raspberry Pi 2 (or 3) will be used to communicate with the FPGA and host the website. The goal of this project will be to develop real-time range finding and host the information online. If deemed appropriate we will add in a database where the user can request logged range-finding data.</p>
<p>The outcomes of this project are to learn more about FPGAs, web development, and radar processing. All generated code will be open-source, available to the public on github.com. The webserver is to be written in GoLang (the Google programming language) and possibly hosted on a domain. </p>
<p>Further development may include scaling the model for longer ranges, improved singal processing, and additional sensors. These sensors will log information regarding temperature, and GPS location. The project is currently under development as required hardware has not arrived yet...</p>
